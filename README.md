## Introduction
This project page provides pytorch code that implements the following paper:

Title: "Enhancing Tomato Disease Identification via UCSGAN: An Advanced CycleGAN-Based Image Augmentation Approach",
code details for submission to The Visual Computer

## Installation
install torch

## Dataset
You can download (https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/plantvillage) and put them to data, then divide the training set and test set into a ratio of 8:2

## Train
Run train_gan.py, and then store the generated ten types of tomato disease leaf images in saved_images for subsequent classification verification

## Results
The ten types of tomato disease leaves generated by USCGAN are shown below

## Classification
After using GAN to generate the images, first select 1,000 images from each category for classification, 
then add the generated images to the original dataset for reclassification, and compare and analyze the 
classification accuracy to verify whether data enhancement has improved. There are a total of 5 classification models, as shown in the classification folder
